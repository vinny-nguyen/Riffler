**Idea:** Guitar playing robot: With Arduino servomotors so it'll press on the frets and pluck the strings at the same time to play songs,
the songs will be Canadian classics since everyone in Canada these days are becoming less and less patriotic, especially with the recent
tariffs, we'll have to stand with each other as a community, as a country, as Canadians.

What we'll need to do:
* Find a dataset of 20 Canadian songs in guitar tabs/midi
* Make a Python script that'll automatically parse through the guitar songs' data
* Manually adjust the MIDI/tabs for the notes and timings to put it into Arduino
